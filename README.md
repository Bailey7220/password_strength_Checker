## Overview

This Password Strength Checker analyzes a provided password and checks for:

- Minimum length (8+ characters)
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one digit
- At least one special character

If the password is strong, the script congratulates the user. If not, it provides specific suggestions to improve the password.

---

## Features

- Checks for all major password complexity requirements
- Provides clear, actionable feedback for weak passwords
- No external dependencies except Python's standard library

---

## How It Works

1. **Input:** The user enters a password.
2. **Checks:** The script uses regular expressions to verify if the password meets each criterion.
3. **Scoring:** For each requirement met, the score increases.
4. **Feedback:** If all requirements are met, the password is marked as strong. Otherwise, the script lists missing elements to help the user improve their password.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the script file

git clone https://github.com/Bailey7220/password_strength_Checker.git

cd password_strength_checker

---

## Usage

Run the script in your terminal:
python password_strength_Checker.py

When prompted, enter a password to check its strength.



---

## Security Considerations

- **For educational use only.** Do not use this tool to check real passwords for critical accounts.
- The script does not store or transmit any passwords.
- Always use unique, strong passwords for your online accounts.

---

## Improvement Ideas

- Check against a list of common passwords to prevent easily guessed choices.
- Add entropy calculation for more advanced strength analysis.
- Build a simple GUI for more user-friendly interaction.
- Support for password generation.
